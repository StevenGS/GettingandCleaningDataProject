xtrain, ytrain, xtest, ytest, subjecttrain and subjecttest contain the data from the downloaded files.
xdata, ydata and subjectdata merge the previous datasets.
features contains the correct names for the xdata dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in meanStdFeatures.
Activity names are approached a similar way.
alldata merges xdata, ydata and subjectdata in an aggregate data set.
Finally, tidydata contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
